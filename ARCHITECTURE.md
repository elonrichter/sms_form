## 1. Purpose

A TCPA-compliant SMS opt-in form. **One repo, deployed once per brand** on Vercel
subdomains. Functionality is identical across deployments; only the theme, brand
config, and env vars change. The app is **stateless** — it holds no database,
persists no PII, and logs no phone numbers. It POSTs consent events to an external
**Aggregator** API.

Implements: SPEC 00 (compliance copy), SPEC 01 (functional contract), SPEC 02
(design/reskin layer).

## 2. Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, React 19 |
| Hosting | Vercel (one project per brand) |
| Styling | CSS Modules + CSS variables generated from `theme.ts` |
| Tests | Vitest (node + jsdom), Testing Library |
| API docs | OpenAPI 3.1 served at `/api/openapi.json`, Swagger UI at `/api/docs` |
| Lint/format | ESLint (`next/core-web-vitals`) + Prettier |
| Hooks/CI | Husky pre-commit + GitHub Actions |

Every `src/**` module has a colocated `*.test.ts(x)`.

## 4. Request / data flow

```
Browser (SubscriptionForm, client)
  │  live validation (validation.ts, phone.ts)
  │  builds consent_text_snapshot from disclosure.ts (== rendered text)
  ▼  POST /api/subscribe   (same-origin, NO token, NO IP, NO timestamp)
Route Handler (app/api/subscribe/route.ts, server)
  │  1. resolve env (env.ts) — fail closed if secrets missing -> 500
  │  2. honeypot -> silently 200
  │  3. rate-limit per IP (rate-limit.ts) -> 429
  │  4. captcha verify if configured (captcha.ts) -> 422
  │  5. re-validate names/country/phone/consent (validation.ts, phone.ts) -> 422
  │  6. re-derive canonical snapshot (disclosure.ts) & compare -> 422 on skew
  │  7. attach Authorization: Bearer <token> + Idempotency-Key
  ▼  POST {AGGREGATOR_API_URL}/v1/subscriptions
Aggregator (external) — derives brand_id from token, captures IP + occurred_at
  ▲  { success, status, duplicate? }
  │  normalize -> { success, message?, status?, duplicate? }   (no raw codes)
Browser renders an animated result overlay (blur fade-in). Error holds ~3s then
fades out and restores the filled form for retry; success/duplicate stay as a
terminal confirmation. In-flight disables submit + shows a spinner.
```

### Key invariants (do not break)
- **Token isolation:** `AGGREGATOR_API_TOKEN` / `CAPTCHA_SECRET` are read only in
  server code via `env.ts` (`import "server-only"`). They never appear in any
  client bundle. Verified in CI by grepping `.next/static`.
- **Snapshot equality:** the text rendered beside the SMS-consent checkbox equals
  `consent_text_snapshot`, re-derived and re-checked server-side.
- **Unchecked by default:** both consent checkboxes initialize unchecked.
- **No PII in logs:** `logger.ts` redacts phone-like sequences; phone numbers are
  never passed to it.
- **Fail closed:** required env (`AGGREGATOR_API_URL/TOKEN`, `SMS_TERMS_URL`,
  `PRIVACY_URL`, `CONSENT_TEXT_VERSION`) throws if missing/invalid.

## 5. Environment variables

See [README.md](./README.md#environment-variables-spec-01-§11) for the full table.
Required (fail closed): `AGGREGATOR_API_URL`, `AGGREGATOR_API_TOKEN`,
`SMS_TERMS_URL`, `PRIVACY_URL`, `CONSENT_TEXT_VERSION`. Optional: `BRAND_NAME`,
`BRAND_SLUG`, `DEFAULT_COUNTRY`, `CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`, `CAPTCHA_SECRET`.

The home page is `force-dynamic`, so env changes take effect on the next request
(no rebuild needed) and the rendered snapshot can never desync from the route.

## 6. Compliance model (SPEC 00 / locked)

The disclosure copy lives **only** in `lib/disclosure.ts` and is not reskinnable.
It contains: recurring automated marketing wording, brand name, "not a condition
of any purchase", "Msg & data rates may apply", frequency, "Reply STOP/HELP", and
Terms + Privacy links. Legal copy contrast stays ≥ 4.5:1 (dedicated
`--color-legal-link` token). Two separate checkboxes; both unchecked by default.

## 7. API

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/api/subscribe` | POST | Submit an opt-in (see OpenAPI for schema/codes) |
| `/api/openapi.json` | GET | OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| `/api/docs` | GET | Swagger UI |

The OpenAPI document (`lib/openapi.ts`) is the contract; it is asserted by
`lib/openapi.test.ts`. **Any API change updates `openapi.ts` in the same commit.**

## 8. Testing

- Unit: every `lib/*` pure module (phone, disclosure, validation, countries,
  rate-limit, logger, theme-css, env, openapi).
- Integration: `app/api/subscribe/route.test.ts` (happy path, honeypot, validation
  failures, snapshot skew, duplicate, 5xx→502, network→502, missing-env→500,
  rate-limit, method-not-allowed) with mocked `fetch`.
- Component: `SubscriptionForm.test.tsx` (unchecked-by-default, submit gating,
  rendered-text == snapshot, real link URLs, happy-path submit → success).

Run: `npm test` (watch) / `npm run test:run` (CI) / `npm run test:coverage`.

## 9. Persistence & migrations

**None today** — the app is stateless by design (SPEC 01). If a database is ever
introduced, follow the protocol in [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](./CODING_GUIDELINES.md#database--migrations)
and document the schema + migration runner here. Until then this section stays
"N/A — stateless".

## 10. Deployment

Vercel auto-detects Next.js. Per brand: new Vercel project → set env vars → add
the brand subdomain → deploy. A reskin additionally swaps `theme.ts`,
`brand.config.ts`, and `public/brand/*`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs
typecheck + lint + tests + build + token-leak check on every push/PR.

## 11. Change log

- **2026-06-17** — Header shows the brand name as a purple text wordmark (from the
  `brandName` runtime prop) instead of the logo image. Country `<select>` shows
  short abbreviations (`🇺🇸 US (+1)`, `🇬🇧 UK (+44)`; `abbr` field, "UK" for GB) in
  a more compact column (30%). Submit button label is now "Subscribe".
- **2026-06-17** — Distinct result transitions: **success** uses a slow (~600ms)
  near-opaque crossfade (form dissolves out as the check/text dissolve in, then
  terminal); **error** blurs the form harder, holds ~4.2s, then un-blurs back to
  the form with data preserved.
- **2026-06-17** — Country dropdown shows a flag emoji per option (selected flag
  visible; 🇺🇸 on the US default) and uses a narrower column. Result overlay
  retuned: **error** auto-fades out after ~3s and **restores the entered data**
  for retry; **success/duplicate** are terminal (stay shown). Tests updated (81).
- **2026-06-17** — Result UX: success/duplicate/error now render as an animated
  **overlay** that blur-fades in over the (inert) form, holds ~3s, fades out, then
  resets the form to empty. Replaces the inline error panel + the prior
  "Try again preserves input" behavior (intentional product change; the manual
  retry is now click/auto-dismiss). New component tests cover the error overlay
  and the auto-reset (79 tests total).
- **2026-06-17** — Design reskin (theme.ts only, per the reskin contract): light/airy
  palette, soft rounded sans-serif headings + system-sans body, wider card
  (440→540px) and tightened vertical rhythm. Fixed an invalid `var(--font-*)` with
  no fallback in the font stacks. Country dropdown + phone moved onto one row
  (`.phoneRow`) to save vertical space (DOM order preserved); page `color-scheme`
  set to light.
- **2026-06-17** — Initial architecture: stateless Next.js form, server route with
  token isolation, compliance-locked disclosure, reskin layer, OpenAPI/Swagger,
  full test suite, CI + pre-commit. 12 review findings remediated (fail-closed
  env, legal-link contrast, dynamic page snapshot sync, captcha submit gating,
  re-entrancy guard, etc.).
